Refworksexport helps your III catalog import records into RefWorks.  Put the
PHP script on your web server, then point to it with a link in each record in
the OPAC.  See the comments in refworksexport.php for usage.  I've also
included a short refworks.js file that adds an "Export to RefWorks" link to the
record page.

Many thanks to Rob Casson for handing the code off to me.
