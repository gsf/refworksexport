Refworksexport helps your III catalog import records into RefWorks.  It's a 
PHP script that you run on your web server, then point to it within each 
record in the OPAC.  See the comments in refworksexport.php for usage.  I've 
also included in this repo a short refworks.js file that adds an "Export to
RefWorks" link to the record page.
